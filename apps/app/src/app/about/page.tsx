        <b>Oh, snappers!</b> Welcome to Hermitcraft Horns! It means a lot to me
        that you're here. ðŸŽ‰
      </p>
      <p>
        As an avid viewer of Hermitcraft, I found myself seeing the same two
        sentiments echoed over and over in the comment sections of the hermits'
        videos: "That would make a great horn!" & "What episode is that horn
        from?"
      </p>
      <p>
        & since there isn't a place to easily create & share those moments, I
        made one!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, you can easily load up any YouTube video in the&nbsp;
        <Link href='/create' className='underline'>
          Create
        </Link>
        &nbsp;tab & create as many downloadable horns of all of your favorite
        Hermit quotes as you want, along with viewing others' favorite quotes
        too! Download as many as you want & use them in your own servers!
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of that, you can find the context of any horn by simply clicking
        'View clip' on a horn & the source video will be automatically loaded
        into the{' '}
        <Link href='/create' className='underline'>
          Create
        </Link>{' '}
        tab with the clip already set up for you so you won't have to wonder
        what episode & how far into the episode it's from! Whether it's from a
        short, an episode or a full stream, you can easily find the context of
        any horn!
      </p>
      <p>
        & of course, this is just the initial release of the site. There will be
        many optimizations & additional features added as our horn collection
        gets bigger, so this is just the beginning.
